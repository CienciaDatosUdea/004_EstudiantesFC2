# Observation about the PEC (perfect electric conductor) boundary conditions

In this case, the wave travels through the bounded interval and boundes off the
edges, producing interference on itself, much as one would expect from a
travelling wave that is fixed at the edges. This is quite different from the
travelling wave, which we see moves freely and uniformly through space.
